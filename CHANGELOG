# Change Log

## [0.7.5] - 2015-07-12
### Changed
- LDAPClient.connect is a coroutine if async param is True. (Issue #1)
- The binding function on Windows uses ldap_sasl_bind instead of the
deprecated ldap_bind.
- The connection procedure (init, set TLS, bind) creates POSIX and Windows
threads to avoid I/O blocking.
- Optional error messages are appended to the Python LDAP errors.

### Added
- New open method for LDAPConnection object to build up the connection.
- New LDAPConnectIter object for initialisation, setting TLS, and binding to the
server.

### Fixed
- LDAPConnection.whoami() returns 'anonymous' after an anonymous bind.
- After failed connection LDAPClient.connect() returns ConnectionError
on MS Windows.
